# MercedesBenz

Hello! 

In order to run this project go to the testng.xml file and execute it. 

This file contains the code to run the test in Chrome and Firefox browsers. For the moment Firefox is commented. 

This test is able to open the Mercedes Benz website in both browsers, click on Our Models and click on Hatchback. 

The click to A Class is pending, since the slot was not possible to be renderized to continue the execution with the driver. 

Thanks for seeing this code. 

Regards, 
Melissa Blanco
